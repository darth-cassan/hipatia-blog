# Welcome to My Test Blog

This is a test markdown file to demonstrate the blog generator functionality.

## Introduction

Hello! This is a sample blog post that we'll use to test the **blog-generator** tool. The generator should convert this markdown file into a beautiful HTML page.

## Features

Here are some features we're testing:

- **Markdown parsing**: Headers, paragraphs, and basic formatting
- **Lists**: Both ordered and unordered lists
- **Code blocks**: For technical content
- **Links**: [Link to GitHub](https://github.com)
- **Images**: ![Sample Image](https://via.placeholder.com/300x200)

### Code Example

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Hipatia Blog!");
}
```

### Another Language

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to the blog."
```

## Formatting Tests

We can test **bold**, *italic*, and `inline code` formatting.

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Unordered List

- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
- Bullet point 3

## Blockquote

> This is a blockquote to test how the blog generator handles quoted text.
> It should look different from regular paragraphs.

## Conclusion

This test markdown file includes various elements that should be properly converted to HTML by the blog-generator. Let's see how it turns out!
